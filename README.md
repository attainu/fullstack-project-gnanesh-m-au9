<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

College Management is a website built to achieve good communication between
college Admin, Faculty and Students. There are mainly 3 users in this project,
Admin,Faculty and Student, as the number of students in a college increases, it is a
tedious job for Management to keep track of all the students, their attendance, and
exam or test marks.

Here we created an online system where each user will be assigned a unique
registration number,using which they can login to their respective dashboards.

 
### Built With
We are using below Technologies, Frameworks, libraries for our project
* [html]()
* [css]()
* [Bootstrap]()
* [javascript]()
* [ReactJS]()
* [NodeJS]()

## Admin Dashboard
Admin, who is the core user of our project, can add other Admins,
Students,Faculty, and Subjects. He can update his profile details, update password, and
can add profile pictures.

### Faculty Dashboard
Similar to Admin, Faculty can update their Profile details, update password and
can add profile pictures, along with this they can mark attendance of students, they can
upload marks of students, and also they can see subjects corresponding to their branch.

### Student Dashboard
Students can update profile details, update password and cam add profile
pictures, they can see their attendance, and exam or test marks in their portal, also
they can see the subjects corresponding to their semester and branch.

### Challenges Faced
*  Faced challenges during uploading images using multer.
* While storing attendance and exam or test marks data in the database.


 ### Future Scopes.
 * Implementing a chat system, where students can interact with each other, and
they can solve their doubts with faculty.
* Faculty can upload resources useful for students.
